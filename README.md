predicting whether an adult has an income over 50k based on several attributes

## Task

In this project I have been working on a binary classification problem with a dataset from Kaggle. Based on several attributes of american individuals I will train, tune and deploy a model that predicts whether the person earns an income equal or higher than 50 k or not. 
This model could be used by financial services providers such as health insurances to decide whether to contact and send an offer of premium insurance coverage to a potential client or not.
